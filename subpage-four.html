		<h2>Peel P50</h2>
		<p1>Named after the town where it was first manufactured, the Peel P50 is England's infamous microcar - truly earning the title, as it's registered as the smallest car in the world. It was originally produced between 1962 and 1965 by the Peel Engineering Company, in which only 50 were made. However, in 2011, Gary Hillman and Faizal Khan put the P50 back into production, this time producing the microcar in both Petrol and Electric models that retail for a modest $17,300 (while it was originally sold for Â£199 back in the 60s).</p1>
