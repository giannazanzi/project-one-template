	Uploaded by an anonymous profile, this image was pulled from Car.info, a website that pools together photos of the same model of car that are uploaded by individual users. The image itself is vintage from the 1950s, and was most-likely a scan of the original photo.

	This image of a man and woman sitting, talking within the BBC, was sourced online from Wheelsage.com through Pinterest. Wheelsage is an online forum as well as automobile brand database, where folks can upload images of cars to discuss. This image was another scan of an original photo.
