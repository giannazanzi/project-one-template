			<p1>The BMW Isetta is an Italian-produced, German-popularized microcar famous for its positively tiny design and iconic front-opening door. The Isetta was originally developed by Iso in 1952-1953 for the 1953 Turin Motor Show, but was licensed out to the Isetta Automobiles of Brazil, Velam in France, and by Iso's own company in both Spain and Belgium. In 1955, the Isetta was licensed out to BMW, which is when the tiny car trult took off. They modified the design, upped the horsepower, and removed one of the back wheels (to reduce the taxes in some countries). The Isetta was produced by BMW until 1962, and over the span of those seven years, managed to produce 136,367 of these much-loved microcars.</p1>
